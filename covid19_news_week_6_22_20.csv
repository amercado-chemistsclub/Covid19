06/26/20,"The WHO has tapped GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in an $18 billion bid to dispense COVID-19 vaccines equitably around the globe. The move comes as several developed nations have invested heavily in vaccine makers for preferred access to those shots. For its part, the trio aims to pool funds into multiple vaccine projects rather than backing a single company. Currently, the group has only raised $3.4 billion toward its goal. "
06/26/20,"The Trump Administration may begin screening multiple people for COVID-19 at the same time in what's known as pool testing, NIAID director Anthony Fauci told the Washington Post on Friday. A group of patients would be given a single coronavirus test, with individual tests to follow in the event of a positive result. This would allow officials to test more people with fewer resources; but pool testing only works if the majority of the population is uninfected, Fauci said."
06/26/20,"Meanwhile, the CDC estimates that 20 million Americans have contracted the virus, based on the number of known cases multiplied by the average rate of antibodies found during serology tests. That's 10 times more than the official case count, which points to a far greater number of asymptomatic patients with the disease, officials said. Some good news? Those boosted stats would also mean the percentage of U.S. COVID deaths is lower than thought. "
06/26/20,"Plus, a ""biohacker"" who once made DIY CRISPR kits thinks he can develop a working COVID-19 vaccine ahead of Big Pharma. Having slapped together his own DNA-based shot with publicly available spike proteins, Josiah Zayner aims to inject himself—and two partners—in order to reproduce trial results from May showing that a DNA vaccine triggered an immune response in monkeys. At least one bioethicist has taken issue with Zayner's sample size. Story"
06/26/20,"Japan is the latest country to go after doses of AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford's COVID-19 vaccine, AZD1222. On Friday, Japanese drugmaker Daiichi Sankyo said it's in talks to carry out formulation, packaging and storage of AZ's shot in Japan. Daiichi said it's also in talks with the Japanese government to ensure the country has the AZD1222 doses it needs. Story"
06/26/20,"Plus, the call for more dexamethasone studies rolled on as U.S. doctors noted that the well-known steroid actually increased the odds of death in mildly ill COVID patients, according to early data from the recently unveiled Recovery Trial. The steroid dampens the body's immune system–good for late-stage patients fighting cytokine storm, but potentially lethal for those in the early throes of the disease. Those patients rely on their immune systems to thwart the infection, doctors say. "
06/26/20,"Meanwhile, as competition between remdesivir and dexamethasone promises to heat up, an infectious disease analyst at GlobalData thinks the drugs might serve patients better as a team. Gilead Sciences' antiviral targets coronavirus symptoms directly, while the well-known steroid dexamethasone slows hyper-inflammatory damage. Remdesivir is already in combo testing with another anti-inflammatory, tociluzimab. "
06/26/20,The FDA has fast tracked NeuroRX and Relief Therapeutics' synthetic peptide Aviptadil to treat COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory symptoms. The drug reduces lung inflammation and protects cells in organs thought to be an entry point for the virus. Aviptadil is currently in phase 2/3  U.S. trials to lower death rates and boost blood oxygen levels in COVID patients. 
06/26/20,"And German drugmaker Merck KGaA said it scored FDA clearance to launch phase 2 studies on its investigational drug, M5049, to treat cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients who develop pneumonia. Results are expected around the end of this year, Merck said. "
06/26/20,"On Thursday, the U.S. broke its record total of new coronavirus infections for the second day in a row, with many states spared early on in the pandemic now facing major outbreaks. In a sign of apparent urgency, the White House will hold a coronavirus task force briefing on Friday afternoon—the first one in nearly two months. "
06/25/20,"The U.S. NIH may own patent rights to the technology behind Moderna's frontrunner COVID vaccine, Axios reports. In a provided statement, NIH scientists took credit for the stabilized spike proteins that enable coronavirus vaccine development, which the government has sought to patent. That increased stake in Moderna's shot could allow the NIH to deploy vaccine tech to other researchers without the drugmaker's consent and would likely aid in broader efforts to make the final dose low-cost and widely available. "
06/25/20,"Meanwhile, Oxford University launched a trial for its COVID-19 vaccine in South Africa—the first in the country and the continent. The university has launched adjacent trials in Brazil and aims to ramp up enrollment in U.K. studies with an extra 10,000 participants. "
06/25/20,"Testing giant LabCorp rolled out a new COVID-19 antibody test that it will offer to biopharmas, blood banks and hospitals. The company's new PhenoSense assay is based on the same platform LabCorp has used to test vaccines for other viral infections such as HIV, Ebola and the flu. In addition to its use in evaluating COVID-19 hopefuls, LabCorp said the new test will also help screen donations of convalescent plasma for the virus. Story"
06/25/20,"A new federal analysis suggests that pregnant women with COVID-19 are more likely to be hospitalized or require mechanical ventilation, but experts have taken issue with the study. The data, provided to the CDC, compared 8,207 pregnant women with 83,250 who were not. More than 31% of those who were pregnant had to be hospitalized compared with 6% of non-pregnant women, but experts at the CDC want to know why those participant numbers are so off.   "
06/25/20,"Amid critiques of the Small Business Administration and the Department of Transportation, the Government Accountability Office (GOA) blasted the CDC on Thursday for its inconsistent COVID testing. The watchdog claimed that failure to adequately test for the virus has confused infection counts, treatments and reopening efforts. "
06/25/20,"Moderna has tapped Catalent to complete fill-finish work on its mRNA vaccine candidate, with plans to churn out an initial 100 million doses for the U.S. market by the third quarter. Catalent will supply vial filling and packaging services at its Bloomington, Indiana biologics plant and aims to support phase 3 shot trials by providing storage, labeling and more at its Philadelphia sites. Story"
06/25/20,"And the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is eyeing manufacturers to produce 4 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses a year, with the goal to provide those shots equitably across the globe. CEPI has poured $829 million into nine different vaccine makers so far and hopes to build two or three plants per vaccine. For shots using newer mRNA platforms, CEPI says it will have to build manufacturing sites from scratch. Story"
06/25/20,The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) human medicines committee is recommending a conditional marketing authorization for remdesivir to treat COVID-19 in patients 12 and up who develop pneumonia or require oxygen support. Committee researchers conducted a rolling review of the drug well ahead of Gilead Sciences' June 5th marketing application. Remdesivir is the first COVID treatment recommended for approval across the continent. 
06/25/20,"Plus, researchers found that cancer patients treated with checkpoint inhibitor therapies—which trigger an immune response to attack tumors—are at greater risk of developing serious COVID symptoms than patients on other treatments like chemo, according to data published in Nature Medicine. Scientists say that the data is too sparse to alter current COVID-19 treatments, but pushed for increased vigilance in patients juggling both diseases. Story"
06/25/20,"And U.S. demand for dexamethasone—recently hailed as a hopeful COVID-19 treatment in an Oxford University study—is outstripping current supplies. Group drug purchaser Vizient, which supplies meds to nearly half of all U.S. hospitals, said demand for the drug had spiked 610% as of Thursday. Plus, the FDA says injectable dexamethasone has been in shortage since February of last year—well before its new COVID indications. Story"
06/25/20,"On the heels of a rocky hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Tuesday, the FDA has launched a new podcast—FDA Insight—that explores the agency's pandemic response. This week's guest? Commissioner Stephen Hahn, in interview with deputy commissioner of medical and scientific affairs, Dr. Anand Shah. "
06/24/20,"Dexamethasone's swift rise as a coronavirus treatment could scupper pricing plans for Gilead Sciences' remdesivir—the current standard in severe COVID-19. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) pegged its estimated price for remdesivir at $4,580 to $5,080 on Wednesday, with one caveat: If dexamethasone's benefits are confirmed via peer review, ICER will have to knock remdesivir's cost-effective price down by several thousand. Story"
06/24/20,"The U.K. government is launching a research program to validate the accuracy of new coronavirus tests in and out of the lab. A suite of British universities, NHS trusts and research groups have joined the review, called the COVID-19 National DiagnOstic Research and Evaluation Platform, or CONDOR, in a push to unite Britain's test validation efforts. Story"
06/24/20,"Ancient med colchicine—used to treat inflammatory diseases for centuries—may curb severe COVID-19, according to new data from a Greek study that tested the drug in 105 hospitalized patients. Of the 55 patients dosed with colchicine, only one grew sicker, while seven of the 50 on antivirals and antibiotics alone became severely ill. American physicians agreed the trial had its limits, but additional U.S. studies are underway to test the old drug against the novel virus."
06/24/20,"Former Merck exec Michael Rosenblatt warned that COVID-19 challenge trials, which intentionally infect patients with the virus to speed up vaccine development, aren't worth the risk. For one, there's still no foolproof treatment for the disease. Coupled with a lack of understanding of the virus' long-term effects and its ability to ravage even young, healthy patients, Rosenblatt fails to see how the dangers are worth it."
06/24/20,"At Tuesday's House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing, NIAID director Anthony Fauci stood by earlier predictions that a COVID vaccine could hit the U.S. market by end of year. Still, Fauci called the U.S. pandemic response a ""mixed bag,"" pointing to a ""disturbing surge"" of cases across the country that signal the virus is far from contained. "
06/24/20,"With case counts plunging back home, the Chinese National Biotec Group (CNBG) nabbed approval to run phase 3 trials of an unnamed COVID-19 shot in patients in the United Arab Emirates. An arm of China's state-owned Sinopharm, CNBG has two shots in the works and joins a host of other Chinese drugmakers—such as Clover and Sinovac—forced to launch human trials abroad. "
06/24/20,"Plus, Japan's successful campaign to thwart the virus could hinder its COVID research. Some 54 coronavirus trials are locked in the recruitment phase, and while Fujifilm's flu med Avigan has already scored approval for COVID-19 in Russia and India, Japan doesn't expect a verdict on the drug until at least July. As domestic cases continue to plummet, Japan may also look overseas to complete its COVID-19 trials."
06/24/20,"AstraZeneca inked a 10th supply deal for its candidate vaccine, AZD1222, tapping Scotland-based Symbiosis Pharmaceutical. AZ kept quiet on the financial details, and it's unclear how many doses Symbiosis aims to provide. "
06/24/20,"And Mumbai-based Ipca Laboratories' partial reprieve from its FDA import alert proved short-lived. Back in March, the FDA allowed the drugmaker to supply active pharmaceutical ingredients for would-be COVID treatment hydroxychloroquine—on an emergency basis, at least. But with that drug's popularity waning, and shortages resolved, the FDA reinstated the import restrictions, Ipca said Wednesday. "
06/24/20,"FDA chief Stephen Hahn broke with the White House before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Tuesday, testifying that ""data and science,"" not ""Warp Speed,"" would dictate its approval of a COVID-19 vaccine. The Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed vaccine program aims to deliver 300 million doses by January, but Hahn said the FDA will work on its own timeline. At the hearing, committee Chairman Frank Pallone also countered President Donald Trump's assertion that the U.S. was performing fewer COVID tests to juke its case counts. "
06/23/20,"Sanofi, absent from the list of reported ""Warp Speed"" finalists, thinks proven tech—not speed—will yield a successful vaccine, CEO Paul Hudson said Monday. Sanofi is working with GlaxoSmithKline on a more traditional protein subunit vaccine, which the company says could be ready next summer. That's months after other companies' stated goals, but even if Sanofi doesn't win the vaccine race, the world will still need its vaccine doses, Hudson said. Story "
06/23/20,"And it's not as if the French pharma has sworn off new vaccine tech: During its R&D day Monday, Sanofi said it had put up $300 million cash, plus $125 million in equity and $1.9 billion in potential milestones toward Translate Bio's mRNA vaccine platform. The partners are looking at ""multiple"" COVID-19 candidates in vivo, aiming to launch human trials in the fourth quarter. Story"
06/23/20,"Drugmakers looking to shift operations stateside might find a new ""onshoring"" utopia in a former Bristol Myers Squibb plant—or so says Lincoln Equities Group, a private equity firm that snapped up the site last week. It's now peddling space at the 433-acre campus in Hopewell, New Jersey to companies already tapped by the U.S. government to boost onshore production of pandemic-related drugs. Story"
06/23/20,"Speaking of American drug manufacturing, India-based contract manufacturer Piramal Pharma Solutions snared a former G&W oral solids plant in Sellersville, Pennsylvania, to beef up its U.S. operations. Piramal plans to convert the site into a possible home for ""COVID-19 management drug opportunities."" The company runs an API facility in Riverview, Michigan, which it expanded earlier this year. Story"
06/23/20,"What's it like juggling cancer treatments with the COVID-19 outbreak? Journalist Katie Couric recently interviewed one patient about her struggles as part of Merck's new virtual oncology series. Future installments of the series,""Katie Couric Explores: Cancer During COVID-19,"" will debut in the coming weeks, highlighting a range of patients and perspectives. Story"
06/23/20,"And Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker said Tuesday that only 2.5% of the 17,617 people who sought testing statewide after attending protests over George Floyd's death tested positive for COVID-19. Demonstrators' use of face masks likely kept those numbers low, Baker said.  "
06/23/20,"Researchers from the U.K.'s Recovery Trial released a data preprint on the effects of dexamethasone in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which showed that a 10-day, 6mg course of the long-established steroid slashed death rates by one-third in patients on ventilators and by one-fifth in those on oxygen support. The drug failed to lower mortality rates in milder cases. More than 2,000 patients were dosed with the drug in the 4,321-person trial, still awaiting peer review. Story"
06/23/20,"A pig study from a team at Britain's Pirbright Institute found that two doses of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine candidate—now known as AZD1222—provided greater immunity against the virus than one did. Pigs given an initial prime dose followed by a booster shot produced a stronger antibody response than those that received a single dose. Now, researchers aim to find out if the same is true in humans. "
06/23/20,"Inovio nabbed $71 million from the U.S. Department of Defense to scale up production of its Cellectra smart devices, used to deliver the company's COVID shot, INO-4800, directly into the skin. Inovio aims to release interim phase 1 results on its DNA-based candidate by month's end, with phase 2/3 efficacy trials slated to begin this summer. Inovio won previous funding to test the Cellectra devices from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Center for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Story"
06/23/20,"And on Sunday, Cipla and the privately held Hetero Labs joined the parade of Indian drugmakers that have scored approval to market a generic form of Gilead Sciences' remdesivir to treat COVID-19. Cipla said it aims to sell the drug for less than 5,000 rupees ($66) per vial. Beximco Pharmaceuticals, based out of Bangladesh, first introduced a remdesivir knock-off in May, with a planned price of $59 to $79 per vial, Reuters reported. "
06/23/20,"And a professor from Chongqing Medical University—which published data Sunday showing antibody levels sank sharply in recovered COVID-19 patients—warned that Chinese patients infected with an earlier form of COVID-19 may also be vulnerable to a common viral mutation, dubbed D614G. The mutation, which boosts the virus' ""spikes,"" has spread rapidly through Europe. Now, some health experts worry that the new strain will scupper vaccine efforts based on an earlier form of the virus. "
06/23/20,"The Trump administration is gunning for the CDC over alleged missteps in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, four top officials told Politico. President Donald Trump and CDC director Robert Redfield have sparred via public statement these past few months; now, amid criticism of its own pandemic leadership, the White House is considering an audit of the agency's response."
06/23/20,"Political pressure to race toward reopening and some very personal threats from the public have spurred health officials to leave their posts, the Washington Post reports. While shutdown measures are broadly popular, public health officials in California, Colorado, Ohio and more have weathered particularly nasty attacks. "
06/22/20,"Gilead Sciences nabbed FDA clearance to test an inhaled form of remdesivir in healthy volunteers as it looks to pit the drug against early-stage COVID-19, CEO Daniel O'Day said Monday. Remdesivir is currently under emergency use authorization from the FDA in hospitalized COVID patients, but the most recent clinical data show the drug is less helpful in mild cases and patients on ventilators. Story"
06/22/20,"The FDA has received a staggering 106 adverse event reports for Abbott Laboratories' divisive ID NOW rapid COVID-19 test—up from 15 false negative reports in mid-May that prompted a rare public warning from agency over the test's accuracy. Now, the FDA is taking flak for authorizing the test in the first place, with critics calling the diagnostic's odds of correctly yielding a positive result—reportedly pegged at 80%—too low to merit approval. Story"
06/22/20,"Backed by local government and the British NIH, the University of Southampton will begin testing a new, swabless coronavirus test in a four-week, at-home trial targeting healthcare workers and students. The trio aims to distribute and collect the saliva-based test kits—designed by the U.K.'s OptiGene—to 14,000 participants each week, amid ongoing reviews of other swabless diagnostics from Chronomics, Avacta, Map Science and more. Story "
06/22/20,"Researchers at China's Chongqing Medical University found that antibody levels in recovered COVID-19 patients sank sharply after two to three months, according to a study published in Nature Medicine. On average, COVID-fighting antibodies dropped more than 70% in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, raising concerns about long-term immunity against the virus. "
06/22/20,"The U.S. and Brazil continue to lead the world in new coronavirus infections, according to a Reuters tally, with U.S. numbers on the rise again as twelve states reported record increases in cases last week. On Saturday, Reuters tallied over 30,000 new cases in the U.S., the highest daily total since May 1. "
06/22/20,"Plus, 183,000 new cases were reported globally on Sunday, according to WHO—the most in a single day since the outbreak started. "
06/22/20,"The National Institutes of Health axed its Orchid study testing the effects of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Over 470 patients were enrolled in the study—run in conjunction with the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute—at the time of its termination. A data and safety monitoring board urged the NIH to stop testing the drug in COVID-19 patients Friday, citing no safety concerns, but no benefit against the virus, either. "
06/22/20,"Meanwhile, Novartis discontinued its own trial on the drug over recruitment challenges. In a Friday release, the Swiss drugmaker said it lacked participants to finish its study on hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients, but it added that no safety or efficacy conclusions had been reached. Novartis pledged to keep supplying the drug for ongoing trials and upon government request. Story"
06/22/20,"On Monday, Indian biotech Cipla won approval from the country's drug regulator to churn out a generic version of Gilead Sciences' remdesivir, dubbed Cipremi, to treat COVID-19. Gilead signed a non-exclusive license with Cipla to market the remdesivir generic in May. For its part, Cipla will offer training on how to administer the drug and run a phase 4 trial studying the antiviral's effect in Indian COVID patients."
06/22/20,"Many COVID-19 treatments fight the disease in its later stages, but Ridgeback Biotherapeutics aims to halt COVID-19 early on with the launch of a dual phase 2 trial of its antiviral, EIDD-2801, in both hospitalized and newly-diagnosed patients who are still at home. Ridgeback hopes that by beating back the disease in its early stages, it can reduce the time patients are infectious and limit the virus' spread. The company has churned out thousands of doses of the drug ahead of a successful run in the clinic. Story"
06/22/20,"Plus, a Jefferies health care strategist thinks the U.S. is likely to get a COVID-19 shot ahead of the November election. The reason for that confidence? Political pressure to launch a vaccine before voters hit the polls, widespread federal funding of vaccine research and lower regulatory hurdles for a vaccine candidate to score emergency approval. Story"
